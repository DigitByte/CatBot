# Hardware Assets Placeholder

Prepared by D. Hoskia

CAD/STL assets were removed intentionally and must be replaced before a hardware release.

Expected locations:
- `catbot_description/mesh_files/`

When you add new assets, update:
- `HARDWARE.md`
- `README.md`
- Any URDF mesh references as needed
