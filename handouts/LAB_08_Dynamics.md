# Lab 08 — Dynamics and Joint Loads

Prepared by D. Hoskia


## Goal
Estimate joint torques for a stance pose.

## Steps
1. Choose a stance configuration.
2. Compute expected torques.
3. Compare against simulation or intuition.

## Deliverables
- Torque table or plot
- Brief interpretation of stability

## Rubric (10 pts)
- 4: Correct dynamics calculation
- 3: Valid results
- 3: Clear interpretation
