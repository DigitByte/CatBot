# Lab 03 — Transform Composition

Prepared by D. Hoskia


## Goal
Compose transforms to map points between frames.

## Steps
1. Choose a point in the hip frame.
2. Use transform chaining to compute the point in base frame.
3. Validate numerically in a notebook.

## Deliverables
- Transform chain derivation
- Numeric result for a test point
- Short explanation of your verification

## Rubric (10 pts)
- 4: Correct transform chain
- 3: Numeric verification
- 3: Explanation clarity
