# Lab 05 — Inverse Kinematics (Foot Placement)

Prepared by D. Hoskia


## Goal
Solve joint angles for a target foot position.

## Steps
1. Choose a reachable foot target.
2. Solve IK analytically or numerically.
3. Validate in simulation.

## Deliverables
- IK method description
- Target and solved joint angles
- Simulation screenshot or plot

## Rubric (10 pts)
- 4: IK method correctly applied
- 3: Verification in simulation
- 3: Clear reporting
