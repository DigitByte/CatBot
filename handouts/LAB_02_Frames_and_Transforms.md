# Lab 02 — Frames and Transforms

Prepared by D. Hoskia


## Goal
Visualize and compute transforms between CatBot frames.

## Steps
1. Launch simulation.
2. Identify three frames: base, hip, foot.
3. Compute the transform from base to foot.
4. Verify in RViz.

## Deliverables
- Frame diagram
- Computed transform (matrix or quaternion + translation)
- RViz screenshot

## Rubric (10 pts)
- 4: Correct transform derivation
- 3: Verification in RViz
- 3: Clear documentation
