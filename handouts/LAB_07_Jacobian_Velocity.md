# Lab 07 — Jacobian Velocity Mapping

Prepared by D. Hoskia


## Goal
Map joint velocities to foot velocities and verify in simulation.

## Steps
1. Apply joint velocity inputs.
2. Predict foot velocity using the Jacobian.
3. Compare with measured velocity in simulation.

## Deliverables
- Predicted vs measured velocity plot
- Error analysis

## Rubric (10 pts)
- 4: Correct velocity mapping
- 3: Clear comparison plot
- 3: Error discussion
