# Lab 04 — Forward Kinematics (Leg)

Prepared by D. Hoskia


## Goal
Compute foot position from joint angles.

## Steps
1. Use the leg chain from the CatBot URDF.
2. Derive FK equations for the foot.
3. Compare to simulation for a few joint sets.

## Deliverables
- FK derivation
- Table comparing derived vs simulated positions
- Plot of foot path for a joint sweep

## Rubric (10 pts)
- 4: Correct FK derivation
- 3: Verification results
- 3: Clear plots and explanation
