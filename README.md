# CatBot

CatBot is a quadruped robotics platform for learning‑by‑building. This repository contains the CatBot codebase, simulation stack, and course materials. It is part of an educational series, but this repo is focused exclusively on CatBot.

**Status:** WIP — hardware assets are being replaced.

## What’s included
- Simulation stack and visualization tools
- Core control and gait packages
- Course materials and notebooks

## What’s separate
- Physical hardware kits and updated CAD assets

## What you’ll learn
- Spatial description and coordinate frames
- Forward and inverse kinematics
- Jacobians and velocity relationships
- Dynamics and forces
- Trajectory generation
- Feedback control for legged robots
- Perception and basic navigation

## Quick start
1. Read `COURSE.md` for the learning path.
2. Follow `setup.md` to set up the software.
3. See `components.md` for hardware context.

## Gamepad control
CatBot supports a PS5 DualSense controller for teleoperation.

## Hardware and trademark
- Hardware kits and CAD assets are distributed separately: `HARDWARE.md`
- Trademark usage: `TRADEMARK.md`
